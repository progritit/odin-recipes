    <p>Welcome to <strong>Hello, Kitchen!</strong> – the tastiest place on the web to mix cooking and coding. Whether you're just getting started in the kitchen or dipping your toes into web development, you're in the right place.</p>

    <p>This website is a creative project designed to help you learn both how to make delicious recipes and how to build modern websites. We believe that food and technology share something in common: both require practice, curiosity, and a pinch of passion.</p>

     <p>On Hello, Kitchen!, you’ll find a growing collection of carefully selected recipes. Many of them are inspired by classic French cuisine – simple, comforting, and full of flavor. Each recipe includes step-by-step instructions perfect for beginners.</p>

     <p>But there’s more to this site than just cooking. Hello, Kitchen! was built as part of an educational journey, using HTML, CSS, and web design principles taught through The Odin Project. That means this is not just a recipe site – it’s a learning sandbox.</p>

    <p>Looking at the code behind each page, you’ll discover how real websites are built. From semantic HTML to responsive design, we’re serving up both digital structure and hearty meals. It’s an appetizing way to sharpen your skills while enjoying the fruits of your labor – literally.</p>

    <p>We focus on making content that’s clean, accessible, and easy to use. Recipes are written with clarity in mind, so even total beginners can follow along without frustration. We’ve also added subtle design touches to make your visit feel warm, inviting, and visually tasty.</p>

    <p>If you're a foodie looking to learn web development, or a developer who wants to explore the culinary arts, Hello, Kitchen! brings both worlds together on one plate. Our goal is to encourage experimentation, both in your kitchen and in your code editor.</p>

    <p>Try your hand at making a creamy <a href="recipes/creme-brulee.html">crème brûlée</a>, a rich <a href="recipes/blanquette-de-veau.html">blanquette de veau</a>, or a hearty <a href="recipes/pot-au-feu.html">pot-au-feu</a>. Along the way, check out the site’s structure and think about how it was built. You’ll soon realize that recipes and websites aren’t so different after all.</p>

    <p>This project is entirely open and beginner-friendly, so feel free to use it as inspiration or a learning template. If you're working through a web development course like The Odin Project, this type of creative project is a great way to show off your skills.</p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting Hello, Kitchen! We hope you leave with a full belly and a curious mind. Keep experimenting, keep learning, and don’t be afraid to break a few eggs—or break a layout. It’s all part of the process.</p>
