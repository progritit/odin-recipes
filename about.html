  <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Clebson</strong>. Welcome to Hello, Kitchen! I come from a background in administrative work and data analysis. I hold a master’s degree in Economics, and for several years, I applied my analytical skills to help organizations make informed decisions based on data. I also worked for many years in administrative roles within training companies, handling processes from student inscription to graduation. While I enjoyed this work, I felt the urge to explore new challenges and creative opportunities.</p>
  <p>This curiosity led me to embark on a new journey: becoming a web developer. Without formal training in programming, I chose to learn as an autodidact, driven by passion and determination. One of the greatest assets in this learning path has been the comprehensive curriculum offered by <strong>The Odin Project</strong>, which has guided me through the fundamentals and beyond.</p>

  <p><em>Hello, Kitchen!</em> is my very first project built during my educational journey with The Odin Project. Creating this recipe website has been an incredible experience, allowing me to apply my new skills in HTML, CSS, and web design practically. I am amazed at how much knowledge and hands-on practice I have gained so far, and this project stands as a proud milestone in my development.</p>

  <p>Learning web development has opened up an exciting new world for me, combining logic, creativity, and problem-solving in ways I hadn’t experienced before. I am motivated to continue expanding my skills, building more projects, and growing as a developer. The journey is challenging but rewarding, and I embrace every step with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Thank you for visiting Hello, Kitchen! I hope my story inspires others who are considering a career change or picking up new skills on their own. Learning never stops, and with the right resources and mindset, anything is possible.</p>
